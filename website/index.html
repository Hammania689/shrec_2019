			<h2><a id="Objective_7"></a>Objective:</h2>
			<p>In the months following our SHREC 2018 - 2D Scene Image-Based 3D Scene<br>
				Retrieval (IBR) track, we have extended the number of the scene categories from the initial 10<br>
				classes to 30 classes [1]. For that reason, we seek to further evaluate the performances of new<br>
				and novel 2D scene Image-based 3D scene model retrieval algorithms using our extended and<br>
				comprehensive benchmark</p>
			<h2><a id="Introduction_15"></a>Introduction:</h2>
			<p>2D scene image-based 3D scene model retrieval is to retrieve 3D scene models given an input 2D<br>
				scene image. This task is far from trivial, for realistic 2D scene images lack 3D geometric context<br>
				as well as semantic information. Due to limited 3D scene benchmarks and vast ambiguity in<br>
				dimensional semantic information between scene images and scene models, 3D model retrieval<br>
				algorithms have consequently been limited to focus on single object retrieval. Our motivation<br>
				behind this research are its extensive contributions to 3D scene understanding as well as<br>
				reconstruction, Autonomous systems, 3D printing, etc.<br>
				Deng et al. [5] collected the ImageNet database which ten years after its inception comprises over<br>
				21,000 synsets indexed and nearly 14.2 million images. While our SHREC 2018 IBR benchmark<br>
				incorporated only 10,000 images from ImageNet and 1000 corresponding scene models from 3D<br>
				Warehouse both equally divided between the 10 indoor and outdoor classes, the initial benchmark<br>
				was far from comprehensive and introduced distinct classes across both indoor and outdoor<br>
				scenes [4].</p>
			<p>To overcome such obstacles, we increased from 10 scene classes to 30 scene classes. Zhou et al.<br>
				collected the Places88 composed a database of 10,624,928 scene images across 434 scene<br>
				categories [3]. Due to class imbalance in ImageNet, we replaced all initial 10 classes as well as<br>
				established new classes with images from Places88. As for our 3D scene models, we kept the<br>
				initial models used in the IBR benchmark and established 20 new classes, each with 100 scene<br>
				models selected from 3D Warehouse.</p>
			<p>Hence, this track seeks participants who will provide new contributions and advanced 2D scene<br>
				images-based 3D scene model retrieval methods for evaluation and comparison. Upon<br>
				submission, we will evaluate and compare results to not only other ExtendedSceneIBR methods<br>
				but also alongside the previously submitted IBR methods. We will provide our methods of<br>
				evaluation, which correspond to those used in the initial IBR track.</p>
			<p>Benchmark Overview:<br>
				Our extended 2D scene image-based 3D scene retrieval benchmark ExtendedSceneIBR expands<br>
				the initial 10 classes of IBR with 20 new classes totaling a comprehensive dataset of 30 classes.<br>
				The ExtendedSceneIBR contains a complete dataset of 30,000 2D scene images (1000 per class)<br>
				and 3,000 3D scene models (100 per class). Example for each class are demonstrated in both Fig.<br>
				1 and Fig. 2.<br>
				In the same manner as the IBR track, we randomly pull 700 images and 70 models from each<br>
				class for training and the remaining 300 images and 30 models are used for testing, as shown in<br>
				Table 1.</p>
			<p>If a method involves a learning based approach(es), results for both the training and testing<br>
				datasets need to be submitted. Otherwise, the retrieval results based on the test and complete<br>
				datasets are needed. To provide future users a complete reference of our benchmark, we will<br>
				evaluate the participating algorithms on both the testing dataset and the complete<br>
				ExtendedSceneIBR benchmark</p>

			<h2><a id="Evaluation_Method_65"></a>Evaluation Method:</h2>
			<p>To have a comprehensive evaluation of the retrieval algorithm, we employ seven commonly<br>
				adopted performance metrics in 3D model retrieval community: Precision-Recall (PR) diagram,<br>
				Nearest Neighbor (NN), First Tier (FT), Second Tier (ST), E-Measures (E), Discounted<br>
				Cumulated Gain (DCG) and Average Precision (AP) [5]. We have developed the related code to<br>
				compute these metrics and will provide them to participants.</p>
