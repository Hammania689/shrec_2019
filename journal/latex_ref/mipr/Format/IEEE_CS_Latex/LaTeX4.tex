The benchmark  

The retrieval performance of submitted results has been evaluated using 7 commonly used retrieval performance metrics. The publicly available benchmark~\cite{SHREC18-SceneSBR-Track}, comparative evaluation results and corresponding evaluation code will enrich and advance the research of 2D scene sketch-based 3D scene retrieval and its applications.



\paragraph{Preliminary Work.} 
To advance this promising research, we organized a challenge on 2D Scene Image-Based 3D Scene Retrieval~\cite{DBLP:conf/3dor/AbdulJLL18, SHREC18-SceneIBR-Track} in the 2018 Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) which is in conjunction with the Eurographics 2018 Workshop on 3D Object Retrieval (3DOR'18) and built the first 2D scene image-based 3D scene retrieval benchmark \textbf{SceneIBR} by collecting 2D images from ImageNet and 3D scenes from 3D Warehouse~\cite{3DWarehouse}. The benchmark contains uniformly classified 10,000 2D scene images and 1,000 3D scene models of ten (10) categories. In this track, seven (7) groups from five countries (China, Chile, USA, UK, and Vietnam) registered for the track, while due to many challenges involved, only three (3) groups successfully submitted ten (10) runs of five methods. To have a comprehensive comparison, seven (7) commonly-used retrieval performance metrics have been used to evaluate their retrieval performance. The publicly available~\cite{SHREC18-SceneIBR-Track} benchmark, comparative evaluation results and corresponding evaluation code, will further enrich and boost the research of 2D scene image-based 3D scene retrieval and its applications.
