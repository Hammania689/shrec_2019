In the months following our SHREC 2018 - 2D Scene Image-Based 3D Scene Retrieval \textbf{(SceneIBR2018)} track \cite{SHREC18-SceneIBR-Track}, we have extended the number of the scene categories from the initial 10 classes in the \textbf{SceneIBR2018} benchmark to 30 classes\cite{MIPR}, resulting in a new benchmark \textbf{SceneIBR2019} which has 30,000 scene images and 3,000 3D scene models. For that reason, we seek to further evaluate the performance of existing and new 2D scene image-based 3D scene retrieval algorithms using this extended and more comprehensive new benchmark.
