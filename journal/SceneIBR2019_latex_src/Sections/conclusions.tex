Our record of successful tracks ( \textbf{SHREC'12} ~\cite{DBLP:conf/3dor/LiSGABBCEFHHJKORSSYYY12, DBLP:journals/cviu/0013LGSBFFFJMOPS14}, \textbf{SHREC'13}~\cite{DBLP:conf/3dor/LiLGSAJST13, DBLP:journals/cviu/0013LGSBFFFJMOPS14}, \textbf{SHREC'14}~\cite{DBLP:conf/3dor/LiLLGSABFFJLOTZ14, DBLP:journals/cviu/LiLLGSABCCFFFLLJKKOTWZZ15}, \textbf{SHREC'16}~\cite{DBLP:conf/3dor/0013LDDFQLLLLOT16} and \textbf{SHREC'18}~\cite{SHREC18-SceneIBR-Track}) as well as participating methods have explored many different approaches to solve the intractable task of 2D to 3D  retrieval. \textbf{SceneIBR2019} provided participants with the most diverse and comprehensive 2D/3D scene dataset to date and participating groups have clearly shown that while challenging this task is possible. It is our hopes that the \textbf{SceneIBR2019} benchmark and results will serve as a useful reference to future methods in 3D Scene Retrieval.
