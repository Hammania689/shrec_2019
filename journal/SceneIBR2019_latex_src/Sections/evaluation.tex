To have a comprehensive evaluation of the retrieval algorithm, we employ seven commonly adopted performance metrics in 3D model retrieval community: Precision-Recall (PR) diagram, Nearest Neighbor (NN), First Tier (FT), Second Tier (ST), E-Measures (E), Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) and Average Precision (AP) \cite{CIVU}. We have developed the related code to compute these metrics and will provide the code to participants.
