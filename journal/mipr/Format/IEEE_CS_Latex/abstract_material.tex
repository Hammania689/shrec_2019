The objective of this track is to evaluate the performance of different 2D scene sketch-based 3D scene retrieval algorithms using a 2D sketch query dataset and a 3D Warehouse model dataset. The benchmark contains 250 scene sketches and 1000 3D scene models, and both are equally classified into 10 classes. In this track,  six groups from five countries (China, Chile, USA, UK, and Vietnam) have registered for the track, while due to many challenges involved, only 3 groups have successfully submitted 8 runs. The retrieval performance of submitted results has been evaluated using 7 commonly used retrieval performance metrics. We also conduct a thorough analysis and discussion on those methods, and suggest several future research directions to tackle this research problem. We wish this publicly available~\cite{SHREC18-SceneSBR-Track} benchmark, comparative evaluation results and corresponding evaluation code, will further enrich and advance the research of 2D scene sketch-based 3D scene retrieval and its applications.
